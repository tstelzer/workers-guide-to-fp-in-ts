This is an introductory tutorial on typed functional programming in TypeScript,
using the extensive toolkit of [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/). You
are in the right place if:

- You want to learn functional programming.
- You want to learn [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/).
- You are being forced into functional programming by your coworkers.

We are using TypeScript and fp-ts to explore this paradigm, but these skills
are transferrable between languages and libraries. You will learn to solve
problems in a typed, functional style using composition and data types, such as
`Optional`, `Either` and whatever else we find useful.

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should bring a solid understanding
and intuition for JavaScript, including its ES6+ feature set and basic
knowledge of TypeScript.

### Work In Progress

As the authors of this tutorial are employed full time, it will grow and evolve
as they find time to write it, but feel free to offer critique and corrections
by opening issues on the repository, or by voicing your suggestions in the
[functional programming slack](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/).
