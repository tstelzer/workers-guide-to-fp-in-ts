## you

- seek a practical introduction to FP without the math
- want to learn typed functional programming in typescript
- want to learn fp-ts
- are being forced into functional programming by your coworkers
- are forcing your coworkers into functional programming, and need a guide to send them off to

## what you'll learn

- solving problems in a typed, functional style
- introduction to the fp-ts ecosystem
- functional programming design thinking
- learning fundamental functional programming concepts:
    - pure functions
    - immutability
    - partial application
    - currying
    - composition
- skillset is mostly transferrable, not specific to typescript

## required knowledge

- solid understanding of javascript
- basic understanding of typescript

## how to approach this tutorial

* note on OOP:
* personally: I write in a functional style at work and a purely functional style in personal projects
* personal pet peev: guides on functional programming that build a strawman argument against OOP using what i would call "imperative code wrapped in classes"
* we may have some overly simplistic code examples to demonstrate pitfalls, if this resembles your style of OOP
* the reality is: FP design thinking is similar in _some_ aspects (e.g. how Haskell type classes resemble interfaces in OO), and _fundamentally different_ in others
* if you want to get the most out of this tutorial, try to empty your mind and don't constantly compare solutions to how you would do it in OOP, it won't do you much good, rather approach it like a beginner of programming

* the tutorials follow a narrative, to keep a red thread through the tutorials
  and to keep it interesting, but mostly to entertain the author as he is
  writing it

## work in progress

* as the author of this guide is employed full time, it will grow and evolve as he finds time to write it
* feel free to critique by opening issues on the repository, or voicing your
  suggestions in the functional-programming slack
