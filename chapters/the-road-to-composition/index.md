And so our journey begins. Our first goal is building an understanding for the
basic building blocks of functional programming, on the road to composition.
In the following chapters you will learn about:

- The value and application of pure functions.
- Data immutability.
- Partial application of functions.
- Function currying.
- Basic function composition.

To build an intuition for these skills, be sure to do the accompanying
exercises.
