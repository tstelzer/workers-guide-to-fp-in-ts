On the road to composition, we&#x27;re building an
understanding for the basic building blocks of functional programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>In chapter one, we will learn to appreciate the simplicitly of pure
functions and data immutability and use this knowledge to start building an item store.</li>
<li>In chapter two, we discover that functions are themselfes values and use
this to further simplify our code. Specifically, we&#x27;re having a look at the higher-order functions <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code>.</li>
<li>Chapter three offers an in-depth look at concept of function signatures and some advanced TypeScript features. </li>
<li>In chapter four, we name a concept that we&#x27;ve been using in previous chapters
without knowing that we did: partial application.</li>
<li>Chapter five builds on this knowledgeand examines the idea of function currying.</li>
<li>Finally, chapter six combines all of the skills we have learned up to this point in exploring function composition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to skip chapters when you feel already comfortable with the concepts,
though it would be advisable to at least skim them to understand the context of
the example code and exercises.</p></div></main></div></body></html>
