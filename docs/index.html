using the extensive toolkit of <a href="https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/">fp-ts</a>. You
are in the right place if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to learn functional programming.</li>
<li>You want to learn <a href="https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/">fp-ts</a>.</li>
<li>You are being forced into functional programming by your coworkers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are using TypeScript and fp-ts to explore this paradigm, but these skills
are transferrable between languages and libraries. You will learn to solve
problems in a typed, functional style using composition and data types, such as
<code>Optional</code>, <code>Either</code> and whatever else we find useful.</p>
<p>To get the most out of this tutorial, you should bring a solid understanding
and intuition for JavaScript, including its ES6+ feature set and basic
knowledge of TypeScript.</p>
