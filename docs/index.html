functions. That&#x27;s it, really. Regardless which part of the program you are
looking at -- from the tiniest, single-responsibility helper, to complex
services, to the full application -- it is all functions; bottom to top.
Modules and services are built by composing small functions into yet another
function with commonly-known, proven abstractions that often originate in
mathematics (lambda calculus, category theory). In fact, the entire application
is expressed as a function.</p>
<p>In this practical and introductory book on typed functional programming
we&#x27;re having a look at the basic tool kit of the paradigm. We&#x27;re using
TypeScript and the extensive ecosystem of the <a href="https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/">fp-ts</a> library,
though these skills are transferrable between languages and libraries.
Once you have learned these concepts, you can use them in almost any other
language that supports functional programming.</p>
<p>This book is for you if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to learn functional programming.</li>
<li>You want a practical introduction to <a href="https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/">fp-ts</a>.</li>
<li>You are being forced into functional programming by your coworkers.</li>
<li>You are forcing your coworkers into functional programming (one could argue, the reason this book exists in the first place).</li>
</ul>
<p>As this is <strong>not</strong> a fundamental introduction to programming in general,
JavaScript or TypeScript, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a solid understanding of ES6+ JavaScript. For example, arrow function syntax will not be explained.</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of TypeScript. For example, primitive types and basic TypeScript syntax will not be explained.</li>
<li>Be familiar with general software development language and basic programming concepts.</li>
<li>Know your way around your own development environment. For example, this book will not guide you through setting up the TypeScript runtime.</li>
</ul>
